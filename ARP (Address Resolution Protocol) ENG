ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Introduction:

	ARP is a network protocol used to resolve associations between IP addresses and 
	physical MAC addresses. It is an essential protocol in the network layer that 
	enables proper routing and communication between network devices.

Basics:

	The ARP protocol operates in the same network layer as the Internet Protocol (IP). 
	It allows determining the physical MAC address corresponding to a specific IP address. 
	When a network device wants to send a message to another device within the same network 
	segment, it uses the ARP protocol to determine the recipient's MAC address.

Operation:

	The ARP protocol operates on a query-response model. The sending device broadcasts 
	an ARP request on the local network, asking for a response with the MAC address 
	corresponding to a specific IP address. The target device replies with an ARP reply, 
	providing its own physical MAC address. The sending device can then use the received 
	MAC address to send the message to the recipient.

Key Features:

	Resolving associations between IP addresses and MAC addresses

	Query-response model
	
	Used within the same network segment

Usage:

	The ARP protocol is commonly used in Ethernet networks where the transmission of 
	IP packets requires physical MAC addresses. It is a vital component for network 
	communication, ensuring that traffic is directed to the correct recipient within the 
	same network segment.

Summary of Protocol Usage:

	The ARP protocol allows resolving associations between IP addresses and MAC 
	addresses within the same network segment. It operates on a query-response model, 
	where a sending device requests the MAC address of the recipient using an ARP request, 
	and the recipient responds with an ARP reply. This enables proper routing and 
	communication between network devices.

	ARP utilizes an ARP cache to store associations between IP addresses and MAC addresses, 
	allowing it to speed up future data transfers. This cache contains information about 
	frequently used address pairs.

Transmission and Reception Ports:

	The ARP protocol does not use specific transmission and reception ports. ARP requests 
	and replies are carried within Ethernet frames and make use of Ethernet's transmission 
	rules. The frames contain Ethernet MAC addresses and related message transmission 
	mechanisms.

	Using Wireshark for Traffic Capture and Analysis:

	Wireshark is an excellent tool for capturing and analyzing ARP traffic. You can use 
	the following filters in Wireshark to capture ARP traffic:

	ARP Requests: "arp.opcode == 1"
	
	ARP Replies: "arp.opcode == 2"

	By using these filters, you can capture only the ARP traffic you want and inspect 
	its packets and details.

Vulnerabilities:

	The ARP protocol has some vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. 
	One well-known vulnerability is ARP spoofing, where an attacker sends false ARP 
	messages to manipulate associations between IP addresses and MAC addresses. This 
	can lead to malicious traffic redirection and, for example, man-in-the-middle 
	attacks.

Known Attacks on the Protocol:

	Some known attacks against the ARP protocol include ARP spoofing, ARP flood, and 
	ARP storm. These attacks aim to manipulate ARP messages or flood the network with 
	ARP requests, causing disruption to network traffic, communication interruptions, 
 	misdirected traffic.

Summary:

	The ARP protocol allows the resolution of associations between IP addresses and MAC 
	addresses in the network layer. It is used in Ethernet networks, operating on a 
	query-response model. The ARP protocol has vulnerabilities such as ARP spoofing 
	and is susceptible to various attacks like ARP floods. Wireshark is a useful tool 
	for analyzing and monitoring ARP traffic.
