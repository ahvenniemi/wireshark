IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

Introduction:

	IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the next-generation internet protocol designed to 
	replace IPv4. It has been developed to meet the growing need for IP addresses and provide 
	improvements in security, traffic management, and network expansion.

Basics:

	IPv6 operates at the same network layer as IPv4 and its purpose is to enable communication 
	between devices in an IP network. IPv6 uses 128-bit IP addresses, offering a significantly 
	larger address space compared to IPv4's 32-bit addresses.

Operation:

	IPv6 operates on similar principles to IPv4. It breaks down data packets into smaller units 
	called IPv6 packets. IPv6 packets contain the source and destination IPv6 addresses, as well 
	as other information such as protocol and checksum fields.

Key Features:

	Expanded Address Space:

	IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing an enormous number of possible addresses to meet the 
	needs of current and future devices.

	Simplified Addressing:

	IPv6 introduces a clearer and simpler address system, making address management and formatting 
	easier.

	Autoconfiguration:

	IPv6 supports automatic IP address assignment, simplifying the process of connecting new 
	devices to the network.

Security:

	IPv6 includes built-in security features such as IPsec support, allowing for encryption of 
	traffic and improved security.

	IPv6 is the future standard for internet protocol and its usage is continuously growing. 
	It is designed to support a wide range of applications and devices, including smart devices, 
	IoT systems, and large-scale network infrastructures. IPv6 is supported by both internet 
	service providers and network device manufacturers.

Summary - Protocol Usage:

	Transmission and Reception Ports:

	IPv6 packets do not have separate ports as they operate at the same network layer as IPv4. 
	Sending and receiving packets relies on IPv6 addresses and routing information.

Vulnerabilities:

	IPv6 protocol has been designed to take into account security considerations and includes 
	improvements compared to IPv4. However, IPv6 can also have its own vulnerabilities, which can affect 
	routing, traffic encryption, or IPsec implementation.

	Transmission and Reception Ports:

	IPv6 packets do not have separate port numbers like the IPv4 protocol. Instead, sending and 
	receiving IPv6 packets relies on IP addresses and routing information. IPv6 packets contain 
	source and destination addresses that define the sender and recipient.

Using Wireshark in the following ways:

	Traffic Filtering:

	You can filter captured traffic based on different criteria such as source or destination address, 
	protocol, or port number. This helps you focus on specific traffic and analyze it in more detail. 
	There are plenty of filtering options, and you can find additional information on creating different 
	filters in Wireshark's documentation.

	Traffic Analysis:

	Wireshark displays captured traffic in detail, including transmitted and received IPv6 packets. 
	You can inspect packet contents, source and destination addresses, protocol fields, and other 
	data elements. Wireshark also provides various statistics, graphical views, and tools for traffic 
	analysis and troubleshooting.

	Filter IPv6 Packets:

	You can filter captured network traffic to display only IPv6 packets. Use the capture filter 
	"ip6" or "ipv6" to see only IPv6 traffic.

	Filter by Source or Destination Address:

	You can filter network traffic to display only IPv6 packets coming from or going to a specific 
	source or destination address. Use the capture filter "ipv6.src == <address>" or "ipv6.dst 
	== <address>", replacing <address> with the desired IPv6 address.

	Filter by Protocol:

	You can filter network traffic to display only IPv6 packets that use a specific protocol (e.g., 
	ICMPv6 or TCP). Use the capture filter "ipv6.proto == <protocol>", replacing <protocol> with the 
	desired protocol number.

	Combined Capture Filters:

	You can combine different capture filters using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. 
	This allows for creating more complex filters, such as filtering IPv6 packets of a specific 
	protocol from a specific source address.

	Using Wireshark with Default Ports:

	IPv6 packets do not have separate default port numbers because they operate at the same 
	network layer as IPv4. Port numbers are related to the application layer, which is higher 
	up in the protocol stack. Port numbers are defined by the application protocol and are not 
	part of the IPv6 packets themselves.

	IPv6 protocol is designed with better security compared to IPv4. However, IPv6 can still 
	have its own vulnerabilities. These may include address disclosures, ICMP attacks, traffic 
	interception, and misuse of routing. It is important to keep IPv6 networks and devices 
	updated and use appropriate security practices to protect the network.

Known Attacks on the Protocol:

	Some of the known attacks on the IPv6 protocol include packet sniffing (traffic interception), 
	address spoofing, routing attacks, and ICMP attacks. These attacks can be carried out using 
	various methods, and their purposes can range from network congestion and data theft to 
	enabling malicious activities.

	IPv6 has known attacks that can target network traffic, devices, or the protocol's operation. 
	Some examples of known IPv6 attacks include traffic interception, address spoofing, routing attacks, 
	and ICMP attacks.

	ICMPv6 Attacks:

	An attacker can send forged ICMPv6 (Internet Control Message Protocol version 6) packets to the 
	target system. Such attacks can disrupt network traffic, such as in denial-of-service attacks 
	(DDoS).

	Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Attacks:

	NDP is the routing protocol used in IPv6 networks, enabling device discovery and network 
	configuration. An attacker can manipulate NDP messages by forging device identities or 
	source addresses, causing harm to network traffic or enabling other types of attacks.

	Router Advertisement (RA) Attacks:

	RA messages are part of the NDP protocol and are used for distributing routing information 
	in IPv6 networks. An attacker can send forged RA messages in the network, leading to incorrect 
	routing of devices or facilitating traffic interception.

	IPv6 Fragmentation Attacks:

	An attacker can send a large number of small IPv6 fragments intended to be reassembled into 
	the original packet at the receiving end. Such attacks can deplete resources in the receiving 
	system as it has to process a large number of fragments.

	Rogue Router Attacks:

	In this attack, an attacker introduces a forged router into the network, aiming to redirect 
	network traffic to itself or perform other malicious actions. This can result in degraded network 
	usability or lead to traffic interception.

Summary:

	IPv6 is the next-generation internet protocol that offers a larger address space, improved security, 
	and other enhancements compared to IPv4. It is designed to meet the needs of current and future network 
	traffic. The adoption of IPv6 is steadily increasing, and attention must be given to its security. 
	Wireshark is a valuable tool for analyzing IPv6 network traffic and identifying vulnerabilities.
