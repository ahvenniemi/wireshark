FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Introduction:

	FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is one of the oldest and most commonly used file 
	transfer protocols on the internet. In this document, we will examine the operation 
	of FTP, its usage, and how to capture and analyze its traffic using Wireshark.

Basics:

	FTP operates on a client-server architecture, where the client program requests 
	files from or sends files to the server. FTP uses two channels for file transfer: 
	the control channel and the data channel. The control channel is responsible for 
	transmitting commands and responses, while the data channel is used for actual file 
	transfer.

Key Features:

	FTP provides various functions for file management and transfer. It includes features 
	such as downloading and uploading files, creating directories, deleting and renaming 
	files, and viewing file system information. These functions enable efficient file 
	transfer over the network.

Usage:

	FTP is widely used for various purposes, such as file sharing, website updates, 
	and backup. It is particularly useful when a reliable and efficient way of transferring 
	large files or a large number of files over the network is needed.

Transmission and Reception Ports:

	FTP uses specific default ports for data transfer. The control channel uses TCP 
	port 21, while active mode data transfer uses TCP port 20 for sending and a dynamically 
	assigned port for return traffic. In passive mode data transfer, the client creates 
	a dynamic port for the data channel on the server.

Using Wireshark for Traffic Capture and Analysis:

	Wireshark is a popular network analysis tool that allows capturing and analyzing traffic. 
	You can use Wireshark in the following ways to analyze FTP traffic:

	Select the network whose traffic you want to monitor.

	Set up Wireshark to capture traffic on the chosen network.
	
	Apply filters to view only FTP traffic.
	
	Analyze the captured packets and their contents.

Vulnerabilities:

	FTP has known vulnerabilities that can expose security risks in data transfer. 
	These vulnerabilities include weak encryption methods, data phishing, passive mode 
	deception, and enabling anonymous access. It is important to be aware of these 
	vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security practices in an FTP environment.

Known Attacks on the Protocol:

	FTP is susceptible to various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, brute 
	force attacks, anonymous FTP attacks, and unauthorized access to files. These attacks 
	can pose security risks and allow unauthorized access or misuse of files. It is important 
	to understand these attacks and implement appropriate security measures in an FTP 
	environment.

Summary:

	FTP is a widely used file transfer protocol, but it also has vulnerabilities that can 
	expose security risks in data transfer. Capturing and analyzing traffic using Wireshark 
	can help identify potential vulnerabilities and attacks. It is important to implement 
	appropriate security practices and consider alternative, more secure file transfer 
	protocols when planning file transfer over the network.
